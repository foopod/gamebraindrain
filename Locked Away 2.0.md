#Locked Away 2.0

Similar to Locked Away (same characters, very similar story line), but with more interactivity.

Story starts 1 month from the end.

You get to read the last entry and now you make decisions on what happens in the next entry. Basically you determine how the story plays out.

When you get to the end (not really the end) then you unlock a new feature to letting you go back and look at your past entries which have previously been locked off. (Journalling software calls it reflective mode which you can enter once a month)

You then get to recall what happened in the month prior, making up some of it as you go along.

Once you are all caught up (i.e. have written your story). You get a chance to make a reflection entry, kind of setting goals going forwards.


## Outlines

#### Day 1

As you look at the screen and you see the entry from yesterday.

Yesterday was average, you have a lot of school work to do and the teacher could have been nicer about it. But you met a girl called Elora. She seems nice.

I guess we need to write up today's entry. Lets see what did I do today

Well the elections happened today, after weeks of campaigning I thought I was getting somewhere. People seemed to know who I was when if I started talking to them about it. Where did I go wrong?

> I should have campaigned harder
> Maybe Jeremy is just a better leader
> I guess I don't have absolute control of my own reputation


I am so fucked, I can't get him out of my head. It's not fair.

#### Day 2
