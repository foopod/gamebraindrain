#Ideas for Games

This is a repository for me to hold onto the ideas I have to make games.

Feel free to help yourself to my amazing ideas :D

#Games that take place in natural landscapes

###Why?
* Lost in the bush
* Ranger
* Scientist

###Locations
* Lost (lost in the bush in New Zealand)
* Coast Explorer (travel the coast mapping out landmarks and features)


#Games for euphemisms for sex

* Burping the worm in the mole hole
* Parking the car (park the car in the garage, have to do it slowly, moaning intensifies)
* Bumping uglies (walking into random ugly people on the street)
