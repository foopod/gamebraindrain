# Taking the Weenie Wagon to Taco Town
####(Thinking up game ideas from euphemisms for sex)

#Intro
The business you grew from scratch hasn't been doing so well. So when your wife leaves you for some other guy that owns a mobile carpet shampooing business, you decide that this place ain't good enough for *player* and the Weenie Wagon.

You decide that you need to shake things up. But where to go? Most other towns already have flourishing mobile hotdog businesses. You need to go somewhere you know you will make an impact.

You choose to pack up your things and drive down the 95 to a place informally known as Taco Town.

Taco Town is widely reguarded in the mobile hotdog sales world as a lost cause, but you are certain that with your specialty expertise you can turn things around.
