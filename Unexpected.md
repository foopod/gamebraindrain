Maybe just you and the AI

AI :
-Human-like
-too smart
-thinks outside the box

Scientist living in the desert studying something awesome. Something goes wrong, unfortunate sandstorm or maybe something paranormal. Now desert/canyon survival.

Have some kit on you with things like GPS, SAT phone, compass.

Story slowly unfolds...

Studying weird hieroglyphs for monument, using new AI technology that recursively learns languages and identifies patterns. Cool stuff, have already learned almost everything that we can here.

But the machine picks up strange things about the monument, accurate to within the nano meter there are scuffs in the rockface that repeat. These newly discovered patterns are at regular intervals and after a few days of machine learning an algorithm to decipher them lead to an image being created. No human could have carved these marks.

The image is a starmap, it shows the skies as they were thousands of years ago from what the machine calculated as a nearby location. 

They take the excavator and the team to a new location a few kilometres away, only to discover basically nothing there. The AI uses scanning techniques to see a hard surface not far below them.

After a few days of excavation they have uncovered a nearly perfect cube balanced perfect on another one. They interlock and there is no chance of movement.

The AI starts scanning it and everyone waits patiently.

Immediately the AI notices something is wrong, it tries to warn the scientists but is struck by a spark from the cube.

The AI lies on the ground next to the cube and some scientist rush back over to it. As soon as you get near to the cube it starts spinning, hovering in place.

It glows blue and in an instant there is a flash of blue light and then everything is dark.

Everything except a blinking light on your AI companion. You walk over and try to resurrect him by jumping him with your phone battery.

He springs back into life and then freaks out. "This is not what we thought it was, we thought it was old. It isn't, its very very new."
