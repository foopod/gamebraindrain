Scenario

A (Activating Event)
Jono is a salesperson in an electronics store and leaves the cabinet unlocked. His manager finds it and yells at him in the back room. Something expensive could have been taken.

B (Beliefs)
In order to be valued, Jono must not make mistakes. I must avoid discomforting experiences. People should always do the right thing.

C (Consequence)
Jono feels guilty, worthless and depressed. He is also angry that his manager yelled at him, it was unprofessional. Jono is going to pick up a bottle of whiskey on the way home.

D & E (Dispute and Emotive reasoning)
Jono should try to avoid mistakes, but no one is perfect and I should try to forgive myself when I do make a mistake. Discomfort isn't fun, but sometimes it isn't avoidable, I had no control over how my boss reacted. It is unfortunate that my boss reacted poorly, he isn't perfect and getting upset about it won't change anything. I don't like feeling like this, but I can stand it. I will go to Yoga tonight, I always feel more relaxed after that.

Going through the following situations while all the time reminding to be mindful.

I want to quit my job and do art full time, mum thinks that it is the wrong move and that I am throwing my career away.
* I need love and approval from those significant to me - and I must avoid disapproval from any source.
* Everyone needs to depend on someone stronger than themselves.

I have had 3 interviews and still can't get a job. I am worthless.
* My unhappiness is caused by things outside my control - so there is little I can do to feel any better.
* To be worthwhile as a person I must achieve, succeed at what ever I do, and make no mistakes.

My best friend cheated on her boyfriend. How can I be friends with her?
* People should always do the right thing. When they behave obnoxiously, unfairly or selfishly, they must be blamed and punished.
* I should become upset when other people have problems and feel unhappy when they're sad.

I am like this because of the way Emma treated me, I was in love and she took advantage, she hurt me, I am broken.
* Events in my past are the cause of my problems - and they continue to influence my feelings and behaviours now.
* I must worry about things that could be dangerous, unpleasant or frightening - otherwise they might happen.

I won't bother wasting my time trying to get the scholarship
* I can be happier by avoiding life's difficulties, unpleasantness, and responsibilities.
* I should not have to feel discomfort and pain - I can't stand them and must avoid them at all costs.

I really want to go to the party, Jannet will be there, but Greg won't drive me and I don't have my license.
* Things must be the way I want them to be - otherwise life will be intolerable.
* Every problem should have an ideal solution, and it is intolerable when one can't be found.

# IDEA

Look after a boy named Ted. Ted's life simulator. You get a view into Ted's life. You can help Ted out by helping him with daily activities. But more importantly, by helping him work out how to be more emotionally cognitive.

Main story events will happen and trigger Ted's reaction. The player can help Ted out, try to distract him with things or dwell on emotions, maybe help him with Mindful meditation or coaching him with rational therapy. Different things help him in different ways, taking time to watch a movie might help, but he might still dwell on the idea when he goes to sleep.
